# BPplus-Reservoir
Reservoir analysis for BPplus files *bpp_Res2*.
Matlab scripts to read BPplus files (\*.xml) and perform reservoir analysis
and estimate some other hemodynamic parameters from blood pressure waveforms.

**This is beta 3 version and hasn't been subjected to extensive testing**

Method for wave intensity analysis is based on: Alun Hughes, Chloe Park, Anenta Ramakrishnan, Jamil Mayet, Nish Chaturvedi, Kim Parker.
Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.

I am grateful to Richard Scott for information about variables in the BP plus XML file.
